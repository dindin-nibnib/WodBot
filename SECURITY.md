## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a vulnerability, please indicate it to me by mail at odinbeuchat.ob@ikmail.com, on telegram @dindin_nibnib or on discord at dindin|nibnib#0202. 
Do NOT create an issue, as it can contain sensitive data, and issues are visible by anybody. If you found a way to get the bot's token, however, please create an issue containing the token. This way, discord's bot will detect it and reset it.
