# dindin-nibnib/WodBot
WodBot (World of dragons podcast's discord bot) is a bot created by @dindin-nibnib for private use only on the [World of dragons podcast's discord server](https://discord.gg/auvtYxBEdk).
This bot is programmed in typescript mainly, using ts-node and discordx, then compiled to javascript, and uses the [discord.js](discord.js.org) library to access discord's api endpoint.
The deploy-commands.js file is programmed in javascript directly, and only uses discord.js. It is used to deploy the different commands to discord's commands rest api.
You can use this code to create a discord bot for yourself, though I'd recommand using my bot template : dindin-nibnib/discordjs-template
