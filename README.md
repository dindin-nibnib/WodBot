# dindin-nibnib/WodBot
WodBot (World of dragons podcast's discord bot) is a bot created by [@dindin-nibnib](https://github.com/dindin-nibnib) for private use only on the [World of dragons podcast's discord server](https://discord.gg/auvtYxBEdk).
This bot is programmed in typescript mainly, using ts-node and discordx, then compiled to javascript, and uses the [discord.js](discord.js.org) library to access discord's api endpoint.
## [deploy-commands.js](https://github.com/dindin-nibnib/WodBot/deploy-commands.js)
The [deploy-commands.js](https://github.com/dindin-nibnib/WodBot/deploy-commands.js) file is programmed in javascript directly, and only uses discord.js. It is used to deploy the different commands to discord's commands rest api.
## Use
You can use this code to create a discord bot for yourself, though I'd recommand using my bot template : [dindin-nibnib/discordjs-template](https://github.com/dindin-nibnib/discordjs-template)
